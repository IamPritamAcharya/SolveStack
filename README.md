## Adding a New Sheet

To add a new problem sheet:

1. Create a `.txt` file inside the `sheets/` directory
   Example: `sheets/Dynamic Programming.txt`

2. Use CSV format:

   ```
   URL,Topic,Difficulty
   ```

3. Example:

   ```
   https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/,Dynamic Programming,easy
   https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/,Dynamic Programming,medium
   https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/,Dynamic Programming,hard
   ```

4. Supported difficulty values:

   * easy
   * medium
   * hard

5. Platform detection is automatic based on URL.

The new sheet will be available automatically after the next build.

---

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamPritamAcharya/Pritam-s-DSA-Sheet.git
cd Pritam-s-DSA-Sheet

npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the application at:

```
http://localhost:5173/Pritam-s-DSA-Sheet/
```

---

## Deployment

To deploy using GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Manual Setup

1. Navigate to repository Settings → Pages
2. Set source to:

   * Branch: `gh-pages`
   * Folder: `/root`
3. Save changes

### Automated Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow is included to automatically deploy on every push to the `main` branch.

---

## Data Persistence

Progress is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

Example format:

```json
{
  "progress:Problem Solving": {
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/": true,
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/": true
  }
}
```

* Data is stored per sheet
* No backend or authentication required
* Clearing browser storage will reset progress

---

## UI Customization

Static content such as labels, headings, and application text can be modified via:

```
src/data/siteContent.json
```

This allows customization without modifying component logic.
